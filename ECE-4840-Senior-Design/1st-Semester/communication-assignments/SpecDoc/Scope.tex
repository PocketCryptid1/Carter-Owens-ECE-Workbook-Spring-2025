    \item \textbf{\underline{General:}} \\
    Prism is a high-performance digital video transmission system designed for FPV (First Person View) drone operation. 
    The system enables real-time video streaming from an onboard camera mounted on a racing drone to a ground-based receiver, 
    such as FPV goggles or an HDMI-compatible display.

    Prism includes both a drone-mounted Video Transmitter (VTX) module and a ground-based Video Receiver (VRX) module. 
    The system operates over a Wi-Fi–based digital RF link and supports two distinct transmission modes:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Low-Latency Mode (Unconfirmed Packets):}  
        Optimized for fast response and minimal transmission delay, suitable for high-speed drone racing.
        
        \item \textbf{High-Quality Mode (Confirmed Packets):}  
        Enables retransmission of missing packets for improved video clarity and reduced artifacts at the cost of additional latency.
    \end{itemize}

    The system also supports two-way communication between the VTX and VRX, enabling features such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uplink telemetry and control signals
        \item Acknowledgment packets for video retransmission
        \item Remote configuration of VTX parameters from the ground station
    \end{itemize}

    Prism is intended as a proof-of-concept implementation for a modular, extensible FPV digital link suitable for educational, research, and experimental drone racing applications.

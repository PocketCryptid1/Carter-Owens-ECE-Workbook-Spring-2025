# Lecture 1

## Exercise  

XOR truth Table

|A B|X|
|---|-|
|0 0|0|
|0 1|1|
|1 0|1|
|1 1|0|

Assume line a has a stuck at 1 error

|A B|X|
|---|-|
|0 0|1|
|0 1|0|
|1 0|1|
|1 1|0|

this becomes NOT B

## This course

* Understand the impact of faults caused by manufacturing defects
  * could also be caused by hardware trojans
* how do we test for faults
  * make chips reliable and secure
* How much time, energy, and cost should be invested in testing
* this class covers test development and execution
  
### Motivation

* Moore's Law (again...)
  * die's could have millions of transistors in a 1cm square
  * impossible to probe every point
  * must just test inputs and outputs
* manufacturing cost per transistor declining over time
* testing cost per transistor increasing over time
* testing tools and methods need to be smarter and more efficient

## Grading

* Homework and Labs
  * Theory Problems
  * Tetramax tool assignments
  * no late assignments (extensions are possible)
* Midterm in class
* Take Home Final
* Mini Project
* Participation
  * Answer Questions in class
  * Interact!!!
---
* Labs (contd.)
  * Use tools installed On EL103 computers
  * **NO PERSISTENT STORAGE**

## Design and Fabs

* Chips are desgined by Design house
* they are built and packaged by a Fab

---

* USA is a leader in chip design
* USA has very few fabs



## Tests

* Tests must be comprehensive but not too long
* must be planned before any fabrication
* model and predict possible defects in the process
* develop logic simulator(testbench)
* develop fault simulator and test generator
* methods to quantify test efficiency

## Verification vs Testing

### definitions
* Design Synthesis
  * given a description of a circuit, design a physical circuit following that design
* Verification
  * Predictive analysis to ensure that the synthesized design will behave as intended
* Test
  * ensure that the physical device has no manufacturing defects

### Exercise: List differences
* verification
  * ensures design is functions correctly
* testing 
  * ensures the design was executed correctly

## Ideal Vs Actual Test

### Problems with ideal tests
* detect every possible defect
* pass all functionally good devices
* fail every single fault
* Incredibly difficult to generate for many real defects
* Computationally prohibitive

### Real Tests
* does not cover all faults
* some good chips may fail
* some defective chips pass
* the number of passing defective chips is called the *defect level*
  
### Testing as a Filter Process
* some good chips fail the test(yield loss)
* some bad chips pass the test (defect level)'

## levels of testing
* chip/chiplet(single die)
* board(multiple dies)
* system(mulitple boards)
---
Rule of 10
* every level costs 10x more than the lower level to test

---
lower levels
* Transistor
* Gate
* RTL
* Architecture

### This class
* Chip level
* Gate Level

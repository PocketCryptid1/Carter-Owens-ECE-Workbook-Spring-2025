# Lecture 2

## Cost of testing
* Design for testability (DFT)
  * area overhead and yeild reduction
  * design to be easier to test
* Software processes
  * test generation and fault simulation
* Manufacturing test
  * Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) Cost

### DFT
* circuits and processes built into chip
* self tests
* probes
* Example
  * Block 1 collects input, communicates to block 2 which generates output
  * Block 1 is not observable
  * Block 2 is not controllable
    * the whole circuit is a black box, we can only apply inputs and read outputs
    * reduces testability
  * to DFT we can add gates to improve the observability of block 1 and controllability of block 2

### ATE
* Purchase of ATE tester (0.5-1 GHz, 1024 pins)
  * fixed cost: $4M
  * variable cost: $5000 per pin
* Running cost
  * Annual maintenance: 2% of price
  * operating cost: $1.5M per year
* total test cost: 11 cents/minute
* 6 seconds per chip test
  * 66 cents per test

## Fault Modeling

C = A'B+AB'
assume a stuck at one fault at the output of AB'

generate an input vector to detect this fault

|A B|C|fault|
|---|-|-----|
|0 0|0|1|
|0 1|1|1|
|1 0|1|1|
|1 1|0|1|

00 or 01 will detect the fault

## Roles of testing

* Detection
  * detect if faults are present
* Diagnosis
  * determine type of fault
* Device characterization
  * determine and correct errors in design or test
* Failure Mode analysis
  * Determine manufacturing process errors

without fault models we do not know what to test for, we cannot exhaustively test

## Structural model

* Netlist Format
* Structural Verilog
  * no behavioral ode
    * no if else
    * no while loops
  * only basic gates and wires

## Worksheet

```verilog
module  HA(a,b,c,f);
            input a,b;
            output c,f;

            wire d,e

AND     A1(.A1(a),.A2(b),.Z(c));
OR      O1(.A1(a),.A2(b),.Z(d));
NOT     N1(.I(c),.ZN(e));
AND     A2(.A1(d),.A2(e),.Z(f));

module  FA(A,B,C,carry,sum)
            input a,b,c;
            output carry,sum;

            wire D,E,F;

HA      HA1(.a(A),.b(B),.c(D),.f(E));
HA      HA2(.a(E),.b(C),.c(F),.f(sum));
OR      OR1(.A1(D),.A2(F),.Z(carry));

 ## Standard Cell Libraries

 we use the TSMC 45nm Library

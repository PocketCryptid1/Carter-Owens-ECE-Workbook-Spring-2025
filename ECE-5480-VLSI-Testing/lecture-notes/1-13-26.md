# Lecture 3

## Single Stuck at fault model
* only 1 line is faulty
* the faulty line is permanently set at 1 or 0
* can be at input or output of gate, not inside
* Ex:
  * a stuck at 0 fault and input a of an and gate
  * represented by an open circuit between a and the gate
  * the input of the gate is connected to ground
  * dont just drive the whole a line to ground
* fault is permanent
* function of the gate is unnafected by the fault
* noted as AND gate s-a-1 or s-b-0

### Exercise

| A B | H | Z | Zf |
|-----|---|---|----|
| 0 0 | 1 | x | x  |
| 0 1 | 1 | x | x  |
| 1 0 | 1 | x | x  |
| 1 1 | 0 | x | x  |

11 immediately eliminated-masks fault
00 and 01 both eliminated-controlling variable

must be 10 output will be 1/0

XOR circuit of 4 nands has 12 fault sites and 24 stuck at faults

### fault notation

if output is x/y x is the no fault value and y is the faulty value

## Fault equivalence

* two faults f1 and f2 are equivalent if all tests that detect f1 also detect f2
* Ex: a and b
  * f1 A_sa0
  * f2 C_sa0

| A B | C | Cf1 | cf2 |
|-----|---|-----|-----|
| 0 0 | 0 | 0   | 0   |
| 0 1 | 0 | 0   | 0   |
| 1 0 | 0 | 0   | 0   |
| 1 1 | 1 | 0   | 0   |

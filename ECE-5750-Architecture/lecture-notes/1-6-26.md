# Lecture 1

## Meltdown

* Hardware bug
* can leak kernel memory
* https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf
---
* demonstrated on many intel x86 cores not AMD
* key: when to suppress load with protection violation(user load to kernel memory) 
  * AMD suppresses early EG at TLB process
  * Intel suppresses late, at end of micro arch process

## Early Computing 

* Massive racks of vacuum tubes
* only a few kilobytes of compute
* costs upwards of 10s of millions

## Modern Computing

* tiny chips
* gigabytes of compute
* much cheaper
  
## What is Computer Architecture

### Application
* games
* OS
* Programs

### Physics
* moving charges
* Semiconductors
 
Gap Between the two too big

Computer Architecture adds abstraction layers between

## ECE 5750 Executive Summary

* Understand much higher detail processors
* Learn principles of building multi-core caches
* learn the technology behind multi-chip processors (Eg: GPUs)

## Single Processor Performance

* peaked in late 90s
* fell off since then and has not increased much

## Upheaval in Computer Design

* last 50 years followed moores law
* last decade, technology scaling slowed
  * Dennard scaling (voltage) over (supply voltage fixed)
    * cooling technology
    * must be cheap and effective for commodity systems
  * Moores law (cost/transistor) over?
  * No competitive replacement for CMOS
  * Energy efficiency constrains everything
  
* Software considerations
  * Parallel systems
  * Heterogeneous system

## Todays main target systems

* Mobile
* Warehouse scale comoputers
* embedded

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

* Provides the platform for the software to use to interact with the hardware
* crucial abstraction
* properties of a good abstraction
  * lasts many generations (portability)
  * used in many ways (generality)
  * provides *convenient* functionality to higher levels
  * provides *efficient* implementation to lower levels
* Provides everything about the hardware that the software can see
* this class will spend a lot of time on things that are hidden from software(outside of ISA)

## Computer Architecture is Design and Analysis

* architecture is an iterative process
* design -> test -> analyze -> improve

## Administrivia

* 2 Exams
  * take-home
  * midterm and final
  * final is comprehensive
  * spend much more time on labs then exams
* Focus
  * part 1 Micro-architecture optimizations
  * part 2 Parallelism
* Research Paper reading
  * most important info will be in papers
  * all necessary papers will be on canvas
  * recommended to read papers before lecture
  * will not be quizzed on them 
* Take Home Brush Up quiz
  * due on 1/13 before class
  * don't procrastinate (dumbass!)
  * *is* graded
  * very small weight
* Grading
  * Brush up quiz
  * Class Participation
  * Exams
  * Programming Assignments
    * Memory prefetching
    * Advanced Speculation
    * Cache coherence verification
  * Theory Questions
  * Some Research add-obn Project (6750)
* Programming Assignments
  * individual or team of two
  * less like a puzzle and more like building a tool
  * much more like cache-lab from last class
  * C/C++
* quizzes/assignments
  * work solo
* Linux Lab EL103
  * all assignments will be evaluated on these machines
  * ensure compilation and functionality on them
  * **NO PERSISTENT STORAGE**
  * back up regularly and be sure to save to box/git


## Taking advantage of parallelism
* increase server throughput
* parallelized hardware
* Amdahl's law: 
  $$ ExTime_{new} = ExTime * [(1-Fraction_{enhanced} + \dfrac{Fraction_{speedup}}{Speedup_{enhanced}})] $$
  $$ Speedup_{overall} = \dfrac{ExTime_{old}}{ExTime_{new}} = \dfrac{1}{(1-Fraction_{enhanced} + \dfrac{Fraction_{enhanced}}{Speedup_{enhanced}})} $$
  Best Possible:
  $$ Speedup_{maximum} = \dfrac{1}{(1-Fraction_{enhanced})}$$
  


## after class todo

* add brush up quiz to trello
* review canvas page to fill out trello
